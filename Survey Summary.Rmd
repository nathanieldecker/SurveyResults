## Introduction

This page summarizes the results of a survey of small rental property owners conducted by Nat Decker of the
[Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley](http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/). Firstly, I want to thank everyone who participated in the survey. As I mentioned in the initial postcard, the owners of small rental properties are not well understood by either academics or policymakers and your answers to these questions will help show the real picture of small rental property ownership. I also want to provide additional thanks to everyone who agreed to participate in a follow-up interview. I truly appreciate your generosity with your time.

```{r SurveyPerformance, include=FALSE}

                                      "Bad Addresses",

                          Number = c(53000, 
                                     bouncebacks %>% filter(MailDate == "First" | MailDate == "Full") %>% nrow,
                                     NA,
                                     nrow(srpos),
                                     sum(srpos$InPopulation == FALSE),
                                     srpos %>% filter(InPopulation == TRUE & Progress < 100) %>% nrow,
                                     srpos %>% filter(InPopulation == TRUE & Progress == 100) %>% nrow,
                                     NA,
                                     sum(srpos$InPopulation == TRUE)),
                          Percent = round((Number/53000)*100,1))
# Now look at the skipped questions
skipped <- srpos %>% filter(InPopulation == TRUE & Progress == 100) %>% map(is.na) %>% map(sum)
```

The survey was solicited by mail and conducted online from March to August 2019. The table below shows the response rate for the survey. A total of 53,000 owners were solicited for the survey. Solicitations consisted of an initial invitation to the online survey via postcard and two rounds of follow-up reminders, also via postcard. The survey consisted of approximately 150 questions covering  a broad range topics including the characteristics of the rental properties, tenants, and owners and detailed questions about the decision-making processes for managing and investing in rental properties. Collectively `r bouncebacks %>% filter(MailDate == "First" | MailDate == "Full") %>% nrow %>% format(big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` solicitations were found to be undeliverable. `r srpos %>% nrow %>% format(big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` owners logged on to the survey. `r sum(srpos$InPopulation == FALSE)` of these owners were found to not be part of the sample population (e.g. the respondent had recently sold their rental property or the property was never a rental). `r sum(srpos$Progress == 100)` respondents clicked through the entire survey and the remaining `r sum(srpos$Progress < 100)` ended the survey prematurely. Not all respondents who clicked through the entire survey answered all applicable questions. The final response rate, including partial responses, was `r round(sum(srpos$InPopulation == TRUE) / (53000) * 100,1)`%. Collectively, respondents owned `r srpos %>% dplyr::select(PortfolioEst) %>% sum %>% format(big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` units.


```{r performance, results="asis"}
pandoc.table(performance_tab, caption="Survey Performance",
             justify = "lrr", # style = "multiline",
             missing = " ", big.mark = ',', split.table = Inf)
```

In addition to the survey I conducted 161 interviews to develop a more detailed understanding of small rental property owners. Interviews were solicited at the conclusion of the online survey and conducted via phone in the weeks after the respondent completed the survey. Interviews generally lasted from thirty minutes to an hour and covered basic information such as the owner's portfolio size, the markets they operated in, and their properties and tenants, and more detailed discussions of their acquisition, financing, rent-setting, maintenance, and tenant selection strategies, and their tenant screening procedures. These conversations are not summarized here.

<!-- Might want to include metro of owner, too (though I'll have to geocode that) -->

The summary below provides a chart or table of how survey-takers answered each question on the survey. Not every survey question is summarized, as a few questions are not very interesting in isolation (e.g. the number of bedrooms of the unit surveyed) or had very few responses. Note that the total number of responses varies from question to question because of incomplete surveys. Some of the questions are cross-tabulated with the portfolio size of the owner. The distribution of survey takers by portfolio size is shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
srpos %>% dplyr::count(`Portfolio Size of Owner`)  %>% kable(caption="Most Respondents had more than 2, but less than 50 units")
```

##  How to read the charts

This summary uses three kinds of charts to present the responses to the survey questions. All charts have **subtitle** that identifies the survey question. Some charts also have a **title** that summarizes a conclusion that I think can be made from the responses to the question. The chart below is a **bar chart with count data**. I use this chart to summarize the responses to multiple choice questions, including questions where the owner could check multiple answers. In these charts the length of each bar represents the number of survey respondents who choose each answer. So, for example, almost exactly 600 respondents reported owning a "single family detached house", whereas only about 100 reported owning a "single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse."

```{r bar_count}
srpos %>% mutate(TYPE = factor(recode(TYPE, "Co-operativeunit above" = "Co-operative",
                               "Condominiumunit above" = "Condominium",
                               "Mobile homeunit above" = "Mobile home",
                               "Single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse (not a condominium)property above" = "Single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse",
                               "Single family detached houseproperty above" = "Single family detached house",
                               "Unit in a property with 2 to 4 housing unitsproperty containing the rental unit identified above" = "Unit in a property with 2 to 4 housing units",
                               "Unit in a property with 5 or more housing unitsproperty containing the rental unit identified above" = "Unit in a property with 5 or more housing units"), levels = rev(c("Single family detached house","Condominium", "Unit in a property with 2 to 4 housing units","Single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse", "Unit in a property with 5 or more housing units", "Mobile home","Co-operative")))) %>% multi_resp_bar(TYPE, "[A subtitle that has the wording of the survey question]", "[Chart Type 1: A Bar Chart with count data]")
```

The chart below is a **bar chart with percent data**. This chart type also summarizes the responses to multiple choice questions, but is meant to show a contrast between owners with different portfolio sizes. Instead of showing the number of respondents who selected each answer, this chart shows the proportion of owners in each category who chose a particular answer. So, for example, about 80% of owners with 1-2 rental units held the surveyed property under their own name (as opposed to setting up a corporation to hold the properties), whereas only about 30% of owners with more than 50 rental units held the surveyed property under their own name. When response rates for questions are low, I sometimes don't divide up the responses by portfolio size and show only 1 bar.

```{r bar_fill}
srpos %>% mutate(OWNTYPEreduced = ifelse(OWNTYPE == "Individual investor, including joint ownership by two or more individuals, such as husband and wife" | OWNTYPE == "Trustee for estate", "Individual", "Corporate")) %>% binned_bar(OWNTYPEreduced,"[A subtitle that has the wording of the survey question]","[Chart Type 2: A Bar Chart with percent data]")
```

The chart below is a **box-plot or box-and-whisker plot**. This chart type summarizes the responses to questions where the respondent entered a numeric value, such as a price, a date, or rent. The box-plot shows the distribution of responses with a white box with a horizontal line through it, two vertical lines extending out from the box, and, sometimes, a few points beyond the end of the lines. The horizontal line in each box shows the median, or middle, response. The ends of the box shows the 25^th^ percentile (bottom of the box) and the 75^th^ percentile (top of the box).  The vertical lines (or "whiskers") extending out from the box show the nearest value that is no further than one-and-a-half times the distance between the 25^th^ percentile and the 75^th^ percentile (the bottom and top of the box). Responses that are higher or lower than these values are shown as dots.

The chart below shows the purchase prices of the surveyed properties, grouped by the portfolio of the owner. This plot tells us that the middle price paid by a respondent with 1-2 properties was about \$150,000. Only 25% of these small portfolio owners paid less than about \$60,000 for the surveyed property (the bottom of the box), and only 25% of small portfolio owners paid more than \$210,000 (the top of the box). All except three small portfolio respondents paid between \$25,000 and \$440,000 (the bottom and top of the whiskers). One small portfolio owner paid \$490,000 for their surveyed property, but this is an outlier (a dot).

```{r boxplot}
srpos %>% filter(LPRICE_clean > quantile(srpos$LPRICE_clean, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE) & LPRICE_clean < quantile(srpos$LPRICE_clean, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% ggplot(aes(`Portfolio Size of Owner`,LPRICE_clean/1000)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 2)) + labs(y = "Purchase price (in thousands)", subtitle = "[A subtitle that has the wording of the survey question]", title = "[Chart Type 3: A Boxplot]")
```

##  What kinds of properties were surveyed?

The survey was limited to the owners of small rental properties. Condominiums were included, as each condominium unit is its own property. Cooperative units were included as well, though only 2 respondents were asked about a cooperative unit. Most of the survey respondents owned a single-family detached house. While the sample was drawn from properties that were identified as having less than 5 units, a few surveyed properties were larger.

```{r TYPE}
srpos %>% mutate(TYPE = factor(recode(TYPE, "Co-operativeunit above" = "Co-operative",
                               "Condominiumunit above" = "Condominium",
                               "Mobile homeunit above" = "Mobile home",
                               "Single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse (not a condominium)property above" = "Single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse",
                               "Single family detached houseproperty above" = "Single family detached house",
                               "Unit in a property with 2 to 4 housing unitsproperty containing the rental unit identified above" = "Unit in a property with 2 to 4 housing units",
                               "Unit in a property with 5 or more housing unitsproperty containing the rental unit identified above" = "Unit in a property with 5 or more housing units"), levels = rev(c("Single family detached house","Condominium", "Unit in a property with 2 to 4 housing units","Single family attached house, rowhouse or townhouse", "Unit in a property with 5 or more housing units", "Mobile home","Co-operative")))) %>% drop_na(TYPE) %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TYPE, TYPE))) + geom_bar() +theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) + coord_flip()
```

## Who Were the Surveyed Owners?

The owners who responded to the survey were quite diverse, reflecting some of the diversity of owners nationwide. Most owners held their properties under their own name, but larger owners were more likely to hold their properties in a corporate entity (mostly LLCs). Individual owners were mostly over 60 years old, male, and white, though younger, female, and non-white owners were not uncommon. 

While no institutional investors responded to the survey (the largest portfolio was `r srpos %>% select(PortfolioEst) %>% max()` units) there were substantial differences in the extent to which rental properties were a major part of the owner's professional life. Small portfolios, for the most part, meant that owners spent relatively little of their work-week managing their properties, whereas portfolios of 50 units or more typically required half or all of individual's working hours. Large-scale owners also were more likely to be real estate professionals, while smaller-scale owners often were retired, or had full- or part-time employment in field that were unrelated to real estate. Larger-scale owners tended to also be wealthier and higher-income than small portfolio owners.

## Acquiring & Holding Rental Properties

The differences between large- and smaller-portfolio owners were also apparent in the acquisition of properties. Smaller-scale owners were more likely to have converted the property from owner-occupied to rental, in part because many of these owners previously lived in the house or had acquired the home through inheritance. While most owners acquired their property at least in part for the rental cash flow, intentions for the income varied. Many small- and mid-sized portfolio owners saw their rental properties as part of their retirement plan and a substantial number of these owners had already retired. Most owners used traditional methods to find and purchase their properties, using brokers, visiting the property, and making standard purchases (as opposed to, for example, buying the property at a foreclosure auction or using a 1031 exchange). Most respondents followed a buy-and-hold strategy.

## What are the tenants like?

Larger-scale owners were more likely to hold properties at the lower end of the market, with lower purchase prices, lower rents, lower-income tenants, and are more likely to have a tenant with a section 8 voucher. There didn't appear to be substantial differences in the range of time tenants lived in their units.

While there was a slight variation in rents by the portfolio size of the owner most of the variation in rents comes from the differences between geographic markets (e.g. San Francisco, CA generally has higher rents than Cleveland, OH) and the units themselves (e.g. 3-BR homes with a yard tend to have higher rents 2-BR units in a duplex with no yard). Owners mostly based rents on their perception of demand for their unit and used online sources like Zillow and Craigslist to understand current demand levels.

To adjust for differences between markets I calculated comparable rents for every unit using the Zillow Rent Index (ZRI). This Index is meant to estimate the rent for units that are comparable to the survey units in terms of geography (by ZIP code), building type (single-family rental v. apartments), size (measured in square feet), and time (by month of the survey response). The comparable estimates have a few weaknesses (e.g. lot size isn't considered, physical quality and floor plans aren't considered), but ZRI comps do provide a useful baseline of the market.

## Profitability & Market

Larger portfolio owners tended to be more likely to have their surveyed unit turn a profit. There didn't appear to be a relationship between market trajectory and owner portfolio size, with most owners reporting rising property values and rents. Total rent collected in 2018 was usually around \$10,000.

## Management

Most respondents manage the surveyed property themselves. Possibly because of small portfolio sizes, management tended to be low-tech, with some owners using spreadsheet software, but many owners using no technological tools at all. When management was contracted out, it was most commonly done for for rent collection, tenant selection, routine repairs, and evictions.

## Maintenance and Capital Improvements

About 75% of owners reported maintaining their properties very diligently. Over the past 2 years nearly all owners reported conducting some routine maintenance on their property, usually about 3 different kinds of jobs. Most owners reported spending less than \$1,000 on routine maintenance for their surveyed property. Capital improvements were also common. Owners mostly reported conducting physical work on properties to bring the units up to their to the own personal standards.

## Tenant Screening and Marketing

Most owners marketed their property using online methods such as Zillow and craigslist. Owners collected a lot of information from prospective tenants for tenant selection. While credit checks were common larger-scale owners were somewhat more likely to report credit check information as most important in tenant selection.

## Turnover

Most owners reported that tenants typically stayed in their unit for less than 5 years. Most owners reported taking steps to avoid turnover including investing in maintenance and providing rent discounts.

## Section 8 vouchers

Larger-scale owners reported having more experience with section 8 voucher tenants. They were more likely to currently have voucher tenants, to have had a voucher tenant in the past, and to accept a new tenant with a voucher. For owners who reported being wary of having a section 8 voucher tenant, most reported being concerned about the regulations and paperwork of the program and the quality of voucher tenants.

```{r SEC8}
srpos %>% binned_bar(SEC8EVER,"Under the current ownership have there EVER been tenants at this property whose rent was partially or completely paid with  Section 8, Housing Choice, or other rental subsidy certificates or vouchers?")

## Tenant Problems

Problems with tenants most often took the form of rent non-payment. Most of these delinquencies were brief, but some owners reported nonpayment for many months, causing cash-flow problems. Owners tended to get in touch with the delinquent tenants and sometimes also began eviction proceedings either simultaneously or soon after getting in touch. Other problems with tenants, such as violence and vandalism, were rarer with about 10% of owners reporting these kinds of disruptions.

## Local Policies

Public regulations and policies were rarely cited as a an operational hindrance, except for property taxes. 20% to 40% of owners reported having their unit inspected in the past 2 years and `r round((srpos %>% filter(INSPRSLT == "Passed inspection") %>% nrow()) / (srpos %>% filter(INSPECTD == "Yes") %>% nrow()) * 100,0)`% of owners who reported having an inspection passed the inspection.

## Financing

Most owners purchased their surveyed properties with a mortgage and used their own cash for the down payment. About half of surveyed properties still had a mortgage. Mortgage insurance, even FHA and VA insurance, was relatively common, particularly among smaller-portfolio owners. Larger portfolio owners reported some difficulty getting financing for their units.

##  Who Responded to the Survey?

Relative to all owners of small rental properties in the US, survey respondents tended to have large portfolios.
```{r portfolioComp, include=FALSE}
portfolio_tab <- tibble(Category = c("Large", 
                                      "Mid", 
                                      "Small",
                                      "1 or 2"), 
                          `Portfolio Size` = c("25+ Units", 
                                     "11-24 Units",
                                     "3-10 Units",
                                     "1-2 Units"),
                          `Distribution of Owners \nNationally` = c(0.043, 0.077, 0.278, 0.602) * 100,
                          `Distribution of Owners \n           survey` = srpos %>% group_by(`Portfolio Size of Owner`) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% mutate(pct = count/sum(count)) %>% dplyr::select(pct) * 100)
```
The sample frame consists of the private owners of 1-4 unit rental properties in the top 150 metros of the US. The sample was created in collaboration with Roofstock, Inc., a firm that provides services to small rental property investors and managers, and uses county assessors and recorders data provided by ATTOM. Roofstock performed extensive owner identity resolution on the ATTOM data to clarify portfolios of small rental properties (owners names alone are insufficient to identify portfolios given different name spellings and the use of LLCs and other legal entities). These estimates of owner portfolio size allowed for a stratification of sample by portfolio size and ensured that owners were not solicited multiple times. Large portfolio owners were over-sampled to provide a clearer picture of a group that is relatively small in the context of all SRP owners.

As anticipated the survey over-sampled larger owners, though the diversity of SRP owners was well-covered among survey respondents. Considered by portfolio size, the largest group of owners, with 1-2 unit portfolios, was represented by `r srpos %>% filter(PortfolioEst <= 2 & InPopulation) %>% nrow` respondents. Geographically, the distribution of respondents was very similar to the distribution of SRPs among the top 150 metros based on American Community Survey data, with some under-sampling of the New York and Los Angeles metros and slight over-sampling from the Portland, OR and San Francisco, CA metros. Considered by legal structure, the respondents disproportionately held their properties in LLCs, relative to the nationwide SRP distribution from the Rental Housing Finance Survey, though nearly half of the total units owned by the respondents were held by individuals.


Stratification by metro?

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# I'm not sure this is useful - might be better to just have a map.
srpos %>% dplyr::count(MSANAME) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% transmute(`Metro Area` = MSANAME,Responses = n) %>% kable(caption = "Responses by metro of rental property")
